              <p> <big><strong>Abstract: </strong>The topological KKMS
                  theorem, a powerful extension of Brouwer's Fixed-Point
                  theorem, was proved by Shapely in 1973 in the context
                  of game theory. We prove a colorful and polytopal
                  generalization of the KKMS Theorem, and show that our
                  theorem implies some seemingly unrelated results in
                  discrete geometry and combinatorics involving colorful
                  settings. For example, we apply our theorem to provide
                  a new proof of the Colorful Caratheodory Theorem due
                  to Barany. We further apply our theorem to obtain a
                  new upper bound on the piercing numbers in colorful
                  $d$-interval families, extending results of Tardos,
                  Kaiser and Alon for the non-colored case. Finally, we
                  apply our theorem to questions regarding fair
                  division.<br>

                  equation<br>
                </big></p>
              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>In 1936, Landau derived
                a model for a dilute hot plasma where fast moving
                particles interact via Coulomb interactions. Instead of
                tracking every particle separately, which would lead to
                a large number of equations, the dynamics is being
                described by the particle density function. This model,
                also known as the Landau equation, does not include the
                effects of Einstein's theory of special relativity.
                However, when particle velocities are close to the speed
                of light, which happens frequently in a hot plasma, then
                relativistic effects become important. A model that
                captures these effects, the relativistic Landau
                equation, was derived by Budker and Beliaev in 1956.<br>
                We study the Cauchy problem for the spatially
                homogeneous relativistic Landau equation with Coulomb
                interactions. The difficulty of the problem lies in the
                extreme complexity of the kernel of the collision
                operator. We present a new decomposition of such kernel.
                This is then used to prove the global Entropy
                dissipation estimate, the propagation of any polynomial
                moment for a weak solution, and the existence of a true
                weak solution for a large class of initial data.<br>

                was a great mathematician, statistician that belonged to
                the African American Community from Central Illinois. He
                was born in 1919 and died in 2010. He got his PhD in
                mathematics from University of Illinois in 1941 under
                the great American mathematician J. L. Doob. David
                Blackwell worked in many areas in mathematics. These
                include Probability Theory, Game Theory, Information

              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>Arithmetic
                combinatorics studies the additive and multiplicative
                structure of subsets of groups, especially finite
                abelian groups such as cyclic groups of prime order, or
                finite dimensional vector spaces over finite fields.
                Insipired by Szemerèdi's regularity lemma, arithmetic
                regularity lemmas are tools used in arithmecit
                combinatorics to produce group theoretic analogues of
                results from graph theory. The arithmetic regularity
                lemma for $F_p^n$ (first proved by Green in 2005) states
                that given $A\subseteq F_p^n$, there exists $H\leq
                F_p^n$ of bounded index such that $A$ is Fourier-uniform
                with respect to almost all cosets of $H$. In general,
                the growth of the codimension of H is required to be of
                tower type depending on the degree of uniformity, and
                must also allow for a small number of non-uniform
                elements. The main result of this talk is that, under a
                natural model theoretic assumption called stability, the
                bad bounds and non-uniform elements are not necessary.
                Specifically, we present an arithmetic regularity lemma
                for $k$-stable sets $A\subseteq F_p^n$, where the bound
                on the codimension of the subspace is only polynomial in
                the degree of uniformity, and where there are no
                non-uniform elements. This result is a natural extension
                to the arithmetic setting of the work on stable graph
                regularity lemmas initiated by Malliaris and Shelah.<br>

                  human vocal tract from speech sounds<br>
                </big></p>
              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>The elementary units
                for human speech are called phonemes, and the utterance
                of each phoneme by a person is governed by a particular
                shape of that person's vocal tract. A mathematical
                description is presented for the shape of the vocal
                tract during the creation of each phoneme, which
                corresponds to the direct problem. Then, a corresponding
                inverse problem is analyzed; namely, the determination
                of the shape of the human vocal tract from the sound
                pressure measurements at the mouth associated with an
                uttered phoneme.<br>

                  functions for signed pattern avoiding permutations</big></p>
              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong></big><big>We consider
                the classical Mahonian statistics on the set
                $B_n(\Sigma)$ of signed permutations in the
                hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ which avoid all patterns in
                $\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is a set of patterns of length
                two.&nbsp; In 2000, Simion gave the cardinality of
                $B_n(\Sigma)$ in the cases where $\Sigma$ contains
                either one or two patterns of length two and showed that
                $\left|B_n(\Sigma)\right|$ is constant whenever
                $\left|\Sigma\right|=1$, whereas in most but not all
                instances where $\left|\Sigma\right|=2$,
                $\left|B_n(\Sigma)\right|=(n+1)!$.&nbsp; We answer an
                open question of Simion by providing bijections from
                $B_n(\Sigma)$ to $S_{n+1}$ in these cases where
                $\left|B_n(\Sigma)\right|=(n+1)!$.&nbsp; In addition, we
                extend Simion's work by providing a combinatorial proof
                in the language of signed permutations for the major
                index on $B_n(21, \bar{2}\bar{1})$ and by giving the
                major index on $D_n(\Sigma)$ for $\Sigma =\{21,
                \bar{2}\bar{1}\}$ and $\Sigma=\{12,21\}$.&nbsp; The main
                result of this paper is to give the inversion generating
                functions for $B_n(\Sigma)$ for almost all sets $\Sigma$
                with $\left|\Sigma\right|\leq2.$<br>

              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>We prove that
                distributional solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes
                equations are not unique in the class of weak solutions
                with finite kinetic energy. Moreover, we prove that
                Hölder continuous weak solutions of the 3D Euler
                equations may be obtained as a strong vanishing
                viscosity limit of a sequence of finite energy weak
                solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.<br>

              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>The Kaczmarz algorithm
                is an iterative method for solving systems of linear
                equations that was introduced by Stefan Kaczmarz in
                1937. The algorithm is now enjoying a resurgence in
                interest, as it has been found useful in data science
                applications. It also has remarkably deep connections to
                complex and harmonic analysis. We shall introduce the
                algorithm, demonstrate some of its features, and present
                some of its applications. Towards the end of the talk,
                we shall outline these deep connections to complex and
                harmonic analysis.<strong></strong></big><span

              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>In algebraic geometry,
                a smooth curve is said to be rational if it is
                isomorphic to $P^1$, the projective line. More
                generally, the gonality of a smooth projective curve is
                the smallest degree of a map from the curve to the
                projective line. There are a few different definitions
                that attempt to generalize the notion of gonality even
                further to higher dimensional varieties. The intuition
                is that the higher these numbers, the further the
                variety is from being rational. We will discuss these
                measures of irrationality and various methods of
                calculating and bounding them. We will mainly focus on
                the examples of hypersurfaces and, more generally,
                complete intersections in projective space. All of these
                terms will be defined and there will be lots of
                accessible examples! </big><big> <br>

                </big></p>
              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>A parking function is a
                kind of labeled lattice path. The Shuffle Conjecture
                states that a certain enumeration of parking functions
                is closely related to an important symmetric function
                basis called the Macdonald polynomials. The Delta
                Conjecture is a generalization with similar ties to
                Macdonald polynomials. We discuss the combinatorics of
                parking functions and the notion of schedules as they
                pertain to these two settings.<br>

              <p> <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>Nonlocal continuum
                  theories such as peridynamics and nonlocal elasticity
                  can capture strong nonlocal effects due to long-range
                  forces at the mesoscale or microscale. For problems
                  where these effects cannot be neglected, nonlocal
                  models are more accurate than classical Partial
                  Differential Equations (PDEs) that only consider
                  interactions due to contact. However, the improved
                  accuracy of nonlocal models comes at the price of a
                  computations cost that is significantly higher than
                  that of PDEs.<br>
                </big></p>
              <p><big>In this talk I will present nonlocal models and
                  the Nonlocal Vector Calculus, a theory that allows one
                  to treat nonlocal diffusion problems in almost the
                  same way as PDEs. Furthermore, I will present current
                  open challenges related to the numerical solution of
                  nonlocal problems and show how we are currently
                  addressing them. Specifically, I will describe an
                  optimization-based local-nonlocal coupling strategy
                  and briefly introduce a technique to improve the
                  performance of Finite Element (FE) approximations.<br>
                </big></p>
              <p><big>The goal of local-nonlocal coupling methods is to
                  combine the computational efficiency of PDEs with the
                  accuracy of nonlocal models. These couplings are
                  imperative when the size of the computational domain
                  or the extent of the nonlocal interactions are such
                  that the nonlocal solution becomes prohibitively
                  expensive to compute, yet the nonlocal model is
                  required to accurately resolve small scale features.
                  Our approach formulates the coupling as a control
                  problem where the states are the solutions of the
                  nonlocal and local equations, the objective is to
                  minimize their mismatch on the overlap of the nonlocal
                  and local domains, and the controls are virtual volume
                  constraints and boundary conditions. I will present
                  consistency and convergence studies and, using
                  three-dimensional geometries, I will also show that
                  our approach can be successfully applied to
                  challenging, realistic problems.<br>
                </big></p>
              <big>Finally, I will introduce a new concept of nonlocal
                neighborhood that helps improving the performance of FE
                methods and show how our approach allows for fast
                assembling in two- and three-dimensional computations.<br>

              <big> <strong>Abstract: </strong>The classification of
                manifolds of positive and non-negative sectional
                curvature is a long standing problem in Riemannian
                geometry. In particular, restricting our attention to
                closed, simply-connected manifolds, there are no
                topological obstructions that allow us to distinguish
                between positive and non-negative curvature, that is, we
                have no examples of manifolds that admit a metric of
                non-negative curvature that do no admit a metric of
                positive curvature. However, with the introduction of
                symmetries, we are able to distinguish between these two
                classes. In this context, I will discuss recent joint
                work with Christine Escher and work with Zheting Dong
                and Christine Escher on non-negatively curved manifolds
                with abelian symmetries.</big><big>&nbsp; <br>

                    Title: Arithmetic regularity with forbidden
                    bipartite configurations</strong> <br>
                  <b>Abstract: </b>Szemeredi’s regularity lemma is a
                  fundamental result in graph theory, which says that
                  sufficiently large finite graphs can be partitioned
                  into a small number of pieces so that the edges
                  between most pairs of pieces are randomly distributed.
                  In other words, the regularity lemma processes finite
                  graphs into ingredients that are either highly
                  structured (namely, the partition of the graph) or
                  highly random (namely, the edges between regular
                  pairs). In 2005, Green introduced arithmetic
                  regularity, which is a group-theoretic analogue of
                  Szemeredi’s result. Green’s work involves
                  decompositions of finite abelian groups into
                  algebraically structured pieces, which behave randomly
                  with respect to some chosen subset of the group. In
                  this talk, I will consider a set $A$ in an arbitrary
                  finite group $G$, such that the bipartite graph on
                  $G\times G$ induced by $x\cdot y\in A$ omits some
                  induced bipartite subgraph of size bounded by a fixed
                  integer $k$. I will present strengthened versions
                  arithmetic regularity in this setting, which yield
                  algebraic structure theorems for sets $A$ as above.
                  This work combines tools from model theory, additive
                  combinatorics, and the structure of compact
                  topological groups. Joint with A. Pillay and C. Terry.<br>

                        Notebook &amp; Bressoud’s conjecture</strong></p>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we discuss two
                      topics. The first topic is about two identities
                      that Ramanujan recorded without proofs in his lost
                      notebook. These two identities are intimately
                      connected with the classical Circle and Divisor
                      problems in number theory, respectively. They
                      involve doubly infinite series of Bessel
                      functions, and in each case, there are three
                      possible interpretations for the double series. We
                      proved the first identity under all three
                      interpretations, and the second under two of them.
                      Furthermore, we discuss many analogues and
                      generalizations of them. This is joint work with
                      Bruce C. Berndt and Alexandru Zaharescu.</p>
                    <p>The second topic is about Bressoud’s conjecture.
                      In 1980, Bressoud obtained an analytic
                      generalization of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon
                      identities. He then tried to establish a
                      combinatorial interpretation of his identity,
                      which specializes to many well-known
                      Rogers-Ramanujan type identities. He proved that a
                      certain partition identity follows from his
                      identity in a very restrictive case and
                      conjectured that the partition identity holds true
                      in general. We discuss Bressoud’s conjecture for
                      the general case and bijective proofs of it.<br>

                    Hilbert's Nullstellensatz gives a dictionary between
                    algebra and geometry; e.g., solution sets to
                    polynomial equations over the complex numbers
                    (varieties) translate to (radical) ideals in
                    polynomial rings. A classical theorem of
                    Zariski-Nagata gives a deeper layer to this
                    correspondence: polynomial functions that vanish to
                    certain order along a variety correspond to a
                    natural algebraic notion called symbolic powers.<br>

                    will explain this theorem, and then pursue a couple
                    of variations on this theme. First, we will consider
                    how the failure of this theorem over ambient spaces
                    with bends and corners allows to study the geometry
                    of such spaces; in particular, we will give bounds
                    on size of local fundamental groups. Second, we will
                    consider what happens when we replace the complex
                    numbers by the integers; we will show that
                    "arithmetic differential geometry" (in the sense of
                    Buium) allows us to obtain a Zariski-Nagata theorem

                  <p><strong>Title: Data and Curse of Dimensionality;
                      Spectral Geometry comes to rescue!</strong></p>
                  <p><b>Abstract:</b> High dimensional data is
                    increasingly available in many fields. However, the
                    analysis of such data suffers the so-called curse of
                    dimensionality. One powerful approach to nonlinear
                    dimensionality reduction is the diffusion-type maps.
                    Its continuous counterpart is the embedding of a
                    manifold using the eigenfunctions of the
                    Laplace-Beltrami operator. Accordingly, one may ask,
                    how many eigenfunctions are required in order to
                    embed a given manifold. In this talk, I will give
                    some background regarding the dimensionality
                    reduction problem, spectral geometry, and show
                    theoretical results for a generalized diffusion map.
                    Specifically, I will show a closed Riemannian
                    manifold can be embedded into a finite dimensional
                    Euclidean space by maps constructed based on the
                    connection Laplacian at a certain time. This time
                    and the embedding dimension can be bounded in terms
                    of the dimension and geometric bounds of the
                    manifold. Furthermore, the map based on heat kernels
                    can be made arbitrarily close to an isometry. In
                    addition, I will give a ‘’real world” example
                    pertaining to paleonthology, that demonstrates how
                    heat kernels and diffusion maps can be used to
                    quantify the similarity of shapes. The empirical
                    results suggest that this framework is better than
                    the metric commonly used in biological
                    morphometrics.</p>

                </big><big> </big><big>
                  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Reaction-diffusion equations arise
                    as models of systems in which spreading and growing
                    forces interact in nontrivial ways, often creating a
                    front (i.e., a moving interface). In many
                    applications it is natural to consider nonlocal
                    interactions, but, mathematically, the resulting
                    equations have a number of new features and
                    technical difficulties; in particular, the
                    comparison principle, which implies that initially
                    ordered solutions remain ordered, no longer applies.
                    I will survey classical results, present several
                    examples of nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations,
                    and then focus on a particular one, the cane toads
                    equation, which is inspired by the invasive species
                    in Australia. In all cases, the emphasis will be on
                    the influence of long-range interactions due to
                    nonlocal terms on the behavior of fronts. In
                    particular, I will show that, surprisingly, the cane
                    toads front propagates slower than the standard
                    methods predict.<br>

                </big><big> </big><big>
                  <p><b>Abstract:</b> In kinetic theory, a large system
                    of interacting particles is described by a particle
                    probability distribution function. One of the first
                    equations derived in such a way was the Boltzmann
                    equation (derived by Maxwell in 1866 and by
                    Boltzmann in 1872). The effect of collisions on the
                    density function is modeled by a bilinear integral
                    operator (collision operator) which in many cases
                    has a non-integrable angular kernel. For a long time
                    the equation was simplified by assuming that this
                    kernel is integrable with a belief that such an
                    assumption does not affect the equation
                    significantly. However, in last 20 years it has been
                    observed that a non-integrable singularity carries
                    regularizing properties, which motivates further
                    analysis of the equation in this setting.<br>
                    We study the behavior in time of tails of solutions
                    to the Boltzmann equation in the non-cutoff regime
                    by examining the generation and propagation in time
                    of $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ exponentially weighted
                    estimates and the relation between them. For this
                    purpose we introduce Mittag-Leffler moments, which
                    can be understood as a generalization of exponential
                    moments. An interesting aspect of the result is that
                    the singularity rate of the angular kernel affects
                    the order of tails that can be propagated in time.
                    This is based on joint works with Alonso, Gamba, and

                    embeddability of graphs and metric spaces into
                    Banach spaces is pivotal to research areas as
                    diverse as:<br>
                    -the design of approximation algorithms in
                    theoretical computer science (sparsest cut problem,
                    multi-commodity flows, approximate nearest neighbor
                    search, sketching…),<br>
                    -topology (Novikov conjecture),<br>
                    -noncommutative geometry (coarse Baum-Connes
                    conjecture),<br>
                    -geometric group theory (Von Neumann’s amenability,
                    Gromov’s program).<br>
                    This non-exhaustive list can be stretched at will
                    since metric spaces, with a wide variety of
                    features, arise in nearly all areas of mathematics.<br>
                    In this talk, I will focus on bi-Lipschitz and
                    coarse embeddings of graphs (finite and infinite)
                    into Banach spaces with some desirable geometric
                    properties. I will discuss fundamental geometric
                    problems of either local or asymptotic nature, in
                    particular purely metric characterizations of
                    “linear” properties of Banach spaces in the spirit
                    of the Ribe program. One of the main goal of the
                    talk is to present some fundamental ideas and
                    techniques, as well as to convey the geometric
                    intuition behind them.<br>

                    study of random matrices goes back to the works of
                    Wishart (1920’s) and Wigner (1930’s). At the time
                    they introduced a special class of models that had
                    explicitly computable joint density functions for
                    their eigenvalues. These joint densities turn out to
                    be specific cases of a more general physical model
                    called Coulomb gas models which describe particles
                    interacting through some Hamiltonian. In this talk
                    we will discuss a specific class of these Coulomb
                    gas models called beta-ensembles which are a partial
                    generalization of the random matrix eigenvalue
                    process. I will begin by introducing a random matrix
                    model and the generalization of its eigenvalue
                    process to a beta-ensemble. We will then discuss how
                    one can study the interactions of individual
                    eigenvalues as the number of them grows to infinity.
                    I will introduce the Sine-beta process, one of the
                    limit processes that appears when the eigenvalues
                    are rescaled to see these “local” interactions, and
                    discuss several results and techniques that may be
                    used for studying this process.<br>

                        </b>Reflected diffusions (RDs) constrained to
                        remain in convex polyhedral domains arise in a
                        variety of contexts, including as “heavy
                        traffic” limits of queueing networks and in the
                        study of rankbased interacting particle models.
                        Sensitivity analysis of such an RD with respect
                        to its defining parameters is of interest from
                        both theoretical and applied perspectives. In
                        this talk I will characterize pathwise
                        derivatives of an RD in terms of solutions to a
                        linear constrained stochastic differential
                        equation whose coefficients, domain and
                        directions of reflection depend on the state of
                        the RD. I will demonstrate how pathwise
                        derivatives are useful in Monte Carlo methods to
                        estimate sensitivities of an RD, and also in
                        characterizing sensitivities of the stationary
                        distribution of an RD. The proofs of these
                        results involve a careful analysis of sample
                        path properties of RDs, as well as geometric
                        properties of the convex polyhedral domain and
                        the associated directions of reflection along
                        its boundary.<br>

                            </b>If Z is a set of points in real n-space,
                            we can ask which polynomials of degree d in
                            n variables vanish at every point in Z. If P
                            is one point of Z, the vanishing of a
                            polynomial at P imposes one linear condition
                            on the coefficients. Thus, the vanishing of
                            a polynomial on all of Z imposes |Z| linear
                            conditions on the coefficients. A classical
                            question in algebraic geometry, dating back
                            to at least the 4th century, is how many of
                            those linear conditions are independent? For
                            instance, if we look at the space of lines
                            through three collinear points in the plane,
                            the unique line through two of the points is
                            exactly the one through all three; i.e. the
                            conditions imposed by any two of the points
                            imply those of the third. In this talk, I
                            will survey several classical results
                            including the original Cayley-Bacharach
                            Theorem and Castelnuovo’s Lemma about points
                            on rational curves. I’ll then describe some
                            recent results and conjectures about points
                            satisfying the so-called Cayley-Bacharach
                            condition and show how they connect to
                            several seemingly unrelated questions in

                                        </b>We provide an overview of
                                        the orbit equivalence theory of
                                        Borel flows. In general, an
                                        orbit equivalence of two group
                                        actions is a bijective map
                                        between phase spaces that maps
                                        orbits onto orbits. Such maps
                                        are often further required to
                                        posses regularity properties
                                        depending on the category of
                                        group actions that is being
                                        considered. For example, Borel
                                        dynamics deals with Borel orbit
                                        equivalences, ergodic theory
                                        considers measure-preserving
                                        maps, topological dynamics
                                        assumes continuity, etc. <br>
                                        Since its origin in 1959 in the
                                        work of H. Dye, the concept of
                                        orbit equivalence has been
                                        studied quite extensively. While
                                        traditionally larger emphasis is
                                        given to actions of discrete
                                        groups, in this talk we
                                        concentrate on free actions of
                                        Rn-flows while taking the
                                        viewpoint of Borel dynamics.<br>
                                        For a free Rn-action, an orbit
                                        can be identified with an
                                        “affine” copy of the Euclidean
                                        space, which allows us to
                                        transfer any translation
                                        invariant structure from Rn onto
                                        each orbit. The two structures
                                        of utmost importance will be
                                        that of Lebesgue measure and the
                                        standard Euclidean topology. One
                                        may than consider orbit
                                        equivalence maps that
                                        furthermore preserve these
                                        structures on orbits. Resulting
                                        orbit equivalences are called
                                        Lebesgue orbit equivalence (LOE)
                                        and time-change equivalence
                                        respectively.<br>
                                        Properties of LOE maps
                                        correspond most closely to those
                                        of orbit equivalence maps
                                        between their discrete
                                        counterparts — free Zn actions.
                                        We illustrate this by discussing
                                        the analog for Rn-flows of
                                        Dougherty-Jackson-Kechris
                                        classification of hyperfinite
                                        equivalence relations.<br>
                                        Orbit equivalences of flows
                                        often arise as extensions of
                                        maps between cross sections —
                                        Borel sets that intersect each
                                        orbit in a non-empty countable
                                        set. Furthermore, strong
                                        geometric restrictions on
                                        crosssections are often
                                        necessary. Following this path,
                                        we explain why one-dimensional
                                        R-flows posses cross sections
                                        with only two distinct distances
                                        between adjacent points, and
                                        show how this implies
                                        classification of R-flows up to
                                        LOE.<br>
                                        If time permits, we conclude the
                                        talk with an overview of
                                        time-change equivalence,
                                        emphasizing the difference
                                        between Borel dynamics and

                                            </b>A pattern in a
                                            permutation is a subsequence
                                            with a specific relative
                                            order. What can we say about
                                            a typical large random
                                            permutation that avoids a
                                            particular pattern? We use a
                                            variety of approaches. For
                                            certain classes we give a
                                            geometric description that
                                            relates these classes to
                                            other types of well-studied
                                            objects like random walks or
                                            random trees. Using the
                                            right geometric description
                                            we can find the the
                                            distribution of certain

                                                is not computable, one

                                  We consider the problem of scheduling
                                  a single-server when there are
                                  multiple parallel stations to serve. A
                                  classic result in scheduling says to
                                  create a station dependent index
                                  consisting of the product of the
                                  holding cost (per customer, per unit
                                  time) times the rate at which the
                                  service can be completed at that
                                  station. The scheduler then
                                  prioritizes work in the order of the
                                  indices from highest to lowest.
                                  Preferences are captured by the
                                  various holding costs. A more natural
                                  method for modeling preferences is to
                                  assign constraints to the highest
                                  priority customers (guaranteeing a
                                  fixed quality of service level) and to
                                  provide best effort service for the
                                  other classes. We consider this
                                  formulation, present conditions for
                                  optimality and show how to construct
                                  an optimal control. We initially focus
                                  on the two station model, then explain
                                  where the results can be extended.

                              {H}(t) \Psi(t)$, as of today draws
                              considerable attention, both in
                              experimental and theoretical research. The
                              simplest model with H(t) = A + Bt,&nbsp; A
                              and B being N x N real hermitian matrices,
                              has a known exact solution in special
                              functions only for N=2, and is known as
                              the multi-level Landau Zener problem
                              (MLZ). However, for a certain class of
                              N-dimensional problems that satisfy
                              phenomenologically determined
                              ``integrability'' conditions, the
                              scattering matrix can be represented in a
                              factorized form, with the elementary
                              scattering events being represented in
                              terms of known 2 x 2 scattering matrices.
                              We reveal the reason that stands behind
                              the aforementioned factorization: Each
                              integrable MLZ problem can be embedded
                              into a system of M linear first-order
                              differential equations with respect to
                              M-dimensional time, that satisfy
                              consistency constraints. Classification of
                              exactly solvable MLZ problems leads to
                              moduli spaces that can be mapped into
                              moduli spaces of smooth complex curves. We
                              will speculate on possible relevance to
                              number theory, and in particular modular
                              forms. Finally we consider a more general,
                              still integrable, so-called BCS model that
                              describes N_ s identical quantum spins,
                              with H(t) = H_C t^{-1} + H_G. It can be
                              efficiently treated by making use of

                              this talk, we will show the hypergeometric
                              functions associated to five one-parameter
                              deformations of Delsarte K3 quartic
                              hypersurfaces in projective space. We
                              compute all of their Picard–Fuchs
                              differential equations; we count points
                              using Gauss sums and rewrite this in terms
                              of finite field hypergeometric sums; then
                              we match up each differential equation to
                              a factor of the zeta function, and we
                              write this in terms of global L-functions.
                              This computation gives a complete,
                              explicit description of the motives for
                              these pencils in terms of hypergeometric
                              motives. This is joint work
